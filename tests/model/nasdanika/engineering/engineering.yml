       description: |+2
         May start with a method in ModelElementViewAction. Then extract into a component which takes descriptors. 
         Introduce EMF components or descriptor adaptor/wrapper including collections wrapper.
         Also, along the same lines - single object properties table using the existing descriptor table components.
         Inject scripts into the head if head consumer is available or below or above the table otherwise.

     - name: Issue effort, cost, benefit, and benefit to cost ratio derived attributes, isWorkable(Increment) function.
       description: |+2
         Actual effort and cost - sum of effort and cost from notes. 
         Also percentage completed - own and effective. progress and effectiveProgress derived attributes.
         Total effort and cost - actual plus in the effort/cost field - estimated remaining (zero if done).
         Effective effort and cost - actual and total (3 effective costs and efforts) - includes all not done children and all not done requirements.
         Introduce EngineeredCapability with derived costs, efforts, and benefits. Issue, feature, and release extend it.
         Effective benefit, total benefit - collected in the opposite way as requirements - in the direction of parent and requiredBy.
         Use HashSet accumulator to avoid loops and scanning issues more than once - derived references allRequirements, allRequiredBy
         Update issue tables with the new attributes.
         Engineer rate - to convert effort to cost. Default is 1.
         Plan can override rate per increment, iherits from engineer if not overridden.

     - name: Planning and scheduling
       description: |+2
         Plan - contains capacity per icrement per engineer and cost budget. Scheduler allocates issues to increments to achieve maximum effective benefit per cost ratio for the increment. 
         How to handle spill-over issues?
         Benefit discount rate - how much more the present benefit is valued over future benefit. Related to it - even benefit stream as well as allocation to categories.
