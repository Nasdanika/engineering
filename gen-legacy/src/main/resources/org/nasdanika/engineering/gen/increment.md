[Increment](${doc-uri}Increment.html) is a period of time to plan [releases](${doc-uri}Release.html) and schedule [issues](${doc-uri}Issue.html) for.
Increments may represent:

* Fixed "physical" periods of time like a month or a quarter, 
* "Logical" periods of time, like phases or stages, e.g. "Phase 1" or "Introduction" and "Growth" stages.

Increments can be organized into a hierarchy. For example, year, quarter, month. 

Increments are used for roadmapping and progress tracking. 

One approach to using increments is a logarithmic scale, e.g. if it is Jan 2021, then define months for Q1 2021, the rest of the quarters for 2021, and just 2022. 
As time progresses and Q2 approaches - define months for Q2 and reschedule whatever was planned for Q2 to its months. Then, as a month approaches, set end dates for releases and issues.
Use the same approach for years, e.g. in Q3 2021 define 2022 quarters and move releases and issues planned for 2022 to its quarters.
