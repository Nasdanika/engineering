[Discussion forum](${doc-uri}Forum.html) which can contain sub-forums and [discussion topics](${doc-uri}Topic.html). 
[Engineered element](${doc-uri}EngineeredElement.html) extends forum, which means that discussions are supported at many model elements:

* [Activities](${doc-uri}Activity.html) and [journeys](${doc-uri}Journey.html),
* [Documents](${doc-uri}Document.html) and document sections, 
* [Modules](${doc-uri}Module.html) and [Products](${doc-uri}Product.html),
* [Personas](${doc-uri}Persona.html), [engineers](${doc-uri}Engineer.html), and [organizations](${doc-uri}Organization.html).

Essentially, for engineered elements discussion forums are the means for owners and experts to support element level focused (micro) communities.
