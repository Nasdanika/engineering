         Refactor source resolver to return a Link instance instead of String. Link is a nested interface of SourceResolver with getText() and getLocation() - location is a URL. 
         Both can be null. If location null then just text, if text is null than a link with text and url being the same.

       description: |+2
         May start with a method in ModelElementViewAction. Then extract into a component which takes descriptors. 
         Introduce EMF components or descriptor adaptor/wrapper including collections wrapper.
         Also, along the same lines - single object properties table using the existing descriptor table components.
         Inject scripts into the head if head consumer is available or below or above the table otherwise.

     - name: Issue effort, cost, benefit, and benefit to cost ratio derived attributes, isWorkable(Increment) function.
       description: |+2
         Actual effort and cost - sum of effort and cost from notes. 
         Also percentage completed - own and effective. progress and effectiveProgress derived attributes.
         Total effort and cost - actual plus in the effort/cost field - estimated remaining (zero if done).
         Effective effort and cost - actual and total (3 effective costs and efforts) - includes all not done children and all not done requirements.
         Introduce EngineeredCapability with derived costs, efforts, and benefits. Issue, feature, and release extend it.
         Effective benefit, total benefit - collected in the opposite way as requirements - in the direction of parent and requiredBy.
         Use HashSet accumulator to avoid loops and scanning issues more than once - derived references allRequirements, allRequiredBy
         Update issue tables with the new attributes.
         Engineer rate - to convert effort to cost. Default is 1.
         Plan can override rate per increment, iherits from engineer if not overridden.

         Plan - contains capacity per icrement per engineer and cost budget. Scheduler allocates issues to increments to achieve maximum effective benefit per cost ratio for the increment. 
         How to handle spill-over issues?
         Benefit discount rate - how much more the present benefit is valued over future benefit. Related to it - even benefit stream as well as allocation to categories.

     - name: Journey to engineering export
       description: |+2
         During generation create YAML engineering model from journey definition with back-links to definitions. 
         Activities and journeys map to issues, personas map to engineers. 
         I.e. journey is a template for an engineering model which then can be executed and tracked.

       description: For named elements. Results in more stable URI which survives adding/removing elements, but will break if the name changes.
     - name: Aliasing, global ID
       description: |+2
         Provide a way to specify a global ID for an element, e.g. increment or engineer - path starting with double-slash (//). 
         In a multi-model scenario all elements with the same id will be logically merged and will appear as a single object in the UI.
         That single object may be explicitly designated by setting "primary" attribute to true computed as the first object found in the hierarchy by the content iterator.
         "guid://" URI for addressing such objects, i.e. "guid" is a reseved schema.
