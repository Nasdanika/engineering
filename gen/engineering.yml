         Loading from the model, show in the view. Remaining effort and remaining cost attributes. If not set then remaining is calculated as a subtraction of spent from previous remaining.
         So the calculation is a running total with ability to override. 
         Remaining cost and effort to engineered capability, but derived. Also totals. And completion percentage.

       description: |+2
         Perhaps some base interface (endeavor). Benefit duality - is not explicitly set is computed from contributing things. E.g. increment benefit computed from release and issue benefits.
         Release benefit computed from feature benefits. For issues, if not set, benefit is computed from the container benefit or release/feature benefit. I.e. feature benefit is spread over
         contributing features.

     - name: Move requires to EngineeredCapabilty 
       description: |+2
         So release and feature can also specify requirements to support high-level roadmapping.
         Introduce allRequirements derived reference. For issue it would be issue's own requirements and requirements of its children.
         For release - own requirements and requirements of features and issues.
         And for features - own requirements and requirements of issues contributing to the feature.
         allRequirements shall not include "contained" requirements. E.g. for child issues if one child requires another it shall not be
         shown. For features if one contributing issue requires another also contributing issue it shall not be shown.
         The same for releases - if two features or issues in the release have requires dependency it shall not be included.
         All requirements reference can be used to generate Gantt roadmap diagrams for products, engineers, and increments.           
       effort: 4 
     - name: Start/end dates to EngineeredCapabilty 
       description: |+2
         Validations that end falls into the increment and other things, e.g. requirements end shall be before required start.

     - name: Filterable and sortable table component - use KnockoutJs 
       description: |+2
         May start with a method in ModelElementViewAction. Then extract into a component which takes descriptors. 
         Introduce EMF components or descriptor adaptor/wrapper including collections wrapper.
         Also, along the same lines - single object properties table using the existing descriptor table components.
         Inject scripts into the head if head consumer is available or below or above the table otherwise.  
       effort: 4 
     - name: Issue effort, cost, benefit, and benefit to cost ratio derived attributes, isWorkable(Increment) function.
       description: |+2
         Actual effort and cost - sum of effort and cost from notes. 
         Also percentage completed - own and effective. progress and effectiveProgress derived attributes.
         Total effort and cost - actual plus in the effort/cost field - estimated remaining (zero if done).
         Effective effort and cost - actual and total (3 effective costs and efforts) - includes all not done children and all not done requirements.
         Introduce EngineeredCapability with derived costs, efforts, and benefits. Issue, feature, and release extend it.
         Effective benefit, total benefit - collected in the opposite way as requirements - in the direction of parent and requiredBy.
         Use HashSet accumulator to avoid loops and scanning issues more than once - derived references allRequirements, allRequiredBy
         Update issue tables with the new attributes.
         Engineer rate - to convert effort to cost. Default is 1.
         Plan can override rate per increment, iherits from engineer if not overridden.
         Percentage completed for releases, features, etc.

     - name: Planning and scheduling
       description: |+2
         Plan - contains capacity per icrement per engineer and cost budget. Scheduler allocates issues to increments to achieve maximum effective benefit per cost ratio for the increment. 
         How to handle spill-over issues?
         Benefit discount rate - how much more the present benefit is valued over future benefit. Related to it - even benefit stream as well as allocation to categories.          
       effort: 8         
     - name: Journey to engineering export
       description: |+2
         During generation create YAML engineering model from journey definition with back-links to definitions. 
         Activities and journeys map to issues, personas map to engineers. 
         I.e. journey is a template for an engineering model which then can be executed and tracked.
