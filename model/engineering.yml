      description: Create a feature explaining relative dates (temporals), bounds, and validations.

      name: Past Due Validations
      description: Use context Date service. Also a warning if getting close and no progress - linear approximation. For endeavors with intervals wihtout start or end - derive start/end from interval start/end
    increment-matching:
      name: Increment matching
      description: |+2
        Defined at either engineer or increment level. 
        Options - explicit/none - endeavor must specify increment, validation of end or overlap, start, end, duration (shall fit into the increment for the entire duration).
        Explicit assignment overrides matching - can be used for endeavors spanning several increments and perhaps not matching any. E.g. a long running feature spanning two or more years.
