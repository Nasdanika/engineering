    past-due-validations:
      name: Past Due Validations
      description: Use context Date service. Also a warning if getting close and no progress - linear approximation. For endeavors with intervals wihtout start or end - derive start/end from interval start/end
    increment-matching:
      name: Increment matching
      description: |+2
        Defined at either engineer or increment level. 
        Options - explicit/none - endeavor must specify increment, validation of end or overlap, start, end, duration (shall fit into the increment for the entire duration).
        Explicit assignment overrides matching - can be used for endeavors spanning several increments and perhaps not matching any. E.g. a long running feature spanning two or more years.
    answer-ranking:
      name: Answer ranking
      description: |+2
        Ranks collection or something like this. Simple way - update rank - long. More advanced way - use some external mechanism and pull data during generation. 
    reporter:
      name: Reporter
      description: |+2
        Add reported Engineer reference to Issue. Opposite reference reportedIssues - nav action similar to All Issues. 
    technology-stack:
      name: Technology Stack
      description: |+2
        Containment reference in Engineer, similar to Domains, render in the navigation menu - idented table or a tree. Experts/expertise - a way track skills. 
    blog:
      name: Blog
      description: |+2
        The same reference type as discussion forum. The difference is that a blog starts with an "answer" topic and may contain questions, and discussion typicall starts with a question and then contains answers.
