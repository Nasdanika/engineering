Discussion forum which can contain sub-forums and [discussion topics](Topic.html). 
[Engineered element](EngineeredElement.html) extends forum, which means that discussions are supported at many model elements:

* [Activities](flow/Activity.html) and [journeys](flow/Journey.html),
* [Documents](Document.html) and document sections, 
* [Modules](Module.html) and [Products](Product.html),
* [Personas](Persona.html), [engineers](Engineer.html), and [organizations](Organization.html).

Essentially, for engineered elements discussion forums are the means for owners and experts to support element level focused (micro) communities.
