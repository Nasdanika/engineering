Endeavor is a base class for things which take time, effort, and money to achieve some benefit - [increments](Increment.html),
and [engineered capabilities](EngineeredCapability.html) - [issues](Issue.html), [features](Feature.html), and [releases](Release.html).

Endeavor may be assigned an [engineer](Engineer.html) responsible for the endeavor completion. 
Endeavor may contain [objectives](Objective.html) and be associated with engineer's objectives.

Engineers may have a certain amount of capacity for a given endeavor, which can be allocated to be spent on [engineered elements](EngineeredElement.html) and [issue categories](IssueCategory.html).
E.g. Joe Doe may have capacity of 80 hours in May and 20 hours of that capacity may be allocated to work on documenting [module](Module.html) X.
