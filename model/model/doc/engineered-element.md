Engineered element is something that is "brought about" by [engineers](Engineer.html) working on [issues](Issue.html) associated with the engineered element.

For example:

* One engineer may be trained by another engineer, 
* [Persona](Persona.html) definition and [goals](Goal.html) my be elicited by interviewing persona representatives.
* Software [Module](Module.html) source code can be modified to add new functionality.
* [Document](Document.html) can be updated by adding new sections or elaborating existing content.
* [Directory](Directory.html) can be populated with resources.
* [Organization](Organization.html) can improve its efficiency by formally defining its services as [activities](flow/Activity.html) and [journeys](flow/Journey.html).

Engineered element may have owning engineers, who have authority over the element, and expert engineers, who know how to use the element, but do not have authority.
E.g. a software library can be owned by a team of engineers and have experts who use the library in their solutions.

Engineered element can define [principles](Principle.html) to support decision making and [align](Alignment.html) [engineered capabilities](EngineeredCapability.html), e.g. issues.
Published formally documented principles are important for Open and Inner Source projects to ensure contribution process efficiency.

Engineers may be [allocated](Allocation.html) some capacity to work on the engineered element's issues for a particular [endeavor](Endeavor.html) and [issue category](IssueCategory.html).
