Goal is an [aim](Aim.html) defined under a [persona](Persona.html) and its sub-types - [engineer](Engineer.html) and [organization](Organization.html).
Goal is something that rarely changes and can be achieved, unlike [principle](Principle.html) which is also an aim, also rarely changes, but it is not achievable, it guides achievement of other aims.
Goals can be organized into a hierarchy. There is no Mission class, a way to model a mission of an engineer or an organization is to define it as a single goal and then define goals as mission children.
