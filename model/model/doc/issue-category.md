A mechanism for grouping/tagging issues. 
E.g. "Good First Issue", "Documentation", "Technical Debt". 
Issue categories can be organized into a hierarchy, e.g. "Technology/Java/Cloud/Spring".

Issue category may be assigned weight which can be used for balanced allocation of efforts into "buckets". 
E.g. "Technical Debt" category may have weight 0.1, which would mean that 10% of each increment shall be spent on addressing technical debt (if there are issues in that category). 

Issue category may also be marked as "cumulative", which means that unspent capacity carries over. 
E.g. if a team spent 8% of their capacity on addressing technical debt in June, then they are expected to spend 12% in July.
