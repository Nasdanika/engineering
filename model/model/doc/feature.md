Feature is a unit of consumption of [product](Product.html) functionality. 
Feature is developed by working on [issues](Issue.html) contributing to the feature and is made available to consumers as part of [releases](Release.html).

Feature can be used by [activities](flow/Activity.html). It may also define activities exemplifying use of the feature. 
Such activities may be referenced from [journeys](flow/Journey.html). 

For example, "Cloud microservice code generator" may define an activity explaining how to generate a microservice code, put it source control, and initiate a first build.
Then, this activity may be referenced from "Create a cloud application" journey.
