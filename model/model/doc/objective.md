Objective is something that should be achieved as part of [endeavor](Endeavor.html) such as an [increment](Increment.html) or a [release](Release.html).
An Objective sets the direction â€” like a destination on a map - _where_ the engineer or an organization want to go.
For example, a quarterly objective or an objective for release 1.0.

Objectives can be contained by engineers and reference endeavors, or they may be contained by endeavors and in this case the endeavor assignee is the "owner" of the objective.

Objectives can contain sub-objectives or they can point to a parent objective contained elsewhere. 
Objectives may contain [key results](KeyResult.html), which are a way to measure progress towards the objective.

Both objectives and key results extend [aim](Aim.html) and as such endeavors and other aims can be [aligned](Alignment.html) to them.

#### Example

Joe Doe works for Acme Corp. 

Acme Corps defines an annual objective aligned to the corporate [goals](Goal.html). 
Then it defines quarterly objectives aligned to the annual objective and key results for quarterly objectives.

When the corporate objectives are published, Joe Doe creates his quarterly objectives and links them with a parent link to several key results of the corporate quarterly objectives.
Then he defines key results under his objectives and aligns his endeavors to the key results. 
As he progresses through the endeavors and completes them, completion of the key results gets updated and rolls-up to his objectives and the corporate objectives.
