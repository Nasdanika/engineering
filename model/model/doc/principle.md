Principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, 
that inform and support the way in which an [engineer](Engineer.html) or an [organization](Organization.html) sets about achieving its [goals](Goals.html)
or addressing goals of their consumers modeled as [personas](Persona.html).

Principles [aims](Aim.html) which form the basis for making decisions.

For example, "Mobile First" can be a principle for UI development, and "Cloud First" can be a server-side development principle
with [the 12 factors](https://12factor.net/) as children (sub-principles).
