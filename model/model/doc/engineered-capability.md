Engineered capability extends both [endeavor](Endeavor.html) and [capability](Capability.html) and is a base class for [issue](Issue.html), [feature](Feature.html), and [release](Release.html).
I.e. it is something that might be required by issues to start working on them and that something takes time, effort, and money to complete.

For example an issue "Build XYZ visualization" for [module](Module.html) B may require "Visualizations" feature of [product](Product.html) A.

Engineered capability can be [aligned](Alignment.html) to [aims](Aim.html). 
E.g. release 1.2.0 may be aligned to meet [goals](Goal.html) of a particular [persona](Persona.html) or annual or quarterly [objective](Objective.html) of an [organization](Organization.html).
